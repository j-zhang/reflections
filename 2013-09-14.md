This week in class we focused on installing Vagrant as a means to run iPython Notebook, and did so in our newly formed groups. The download itself took some time during class, but I managed to run through all the steps up past vagrant up. The next command, vagrant ssh, was where the processed hit a roadblock for me; I was unable to SSH into the machine. At first I tried installing PuTTY, but I needed more than an SSH client, so I spent some time after class downloading Cygwin. After installing and running Cygwin, I went to OH to ask for guidance and help. Because of the outage on campus, we weren't able to get far, and ran into other roadblocks, but I am hoping to resolve this problem on Windows soon.

Forming groups has been a positive this week, and our group is working well together. Throughout the week we've been on track and everyone is on the same page in terms of following the steps and keeping on track. Two have Windows and two have Macs, and we've been able to help each other out, as well as document our progress and steps. On Thursday, when coming up with our pluses and deltas, I thought recording our notes on our group page might be helpful. In editting the markdown, I was interested in formatting and styling on GitHub. Searching through the Internet was helpful in finding documentation and tips on GitHub flavored markdown, including:

+ http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet
+ http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
+ https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown

Thinking about next week and future classes, I think using our group as a resource will be very helpful. We are already all connected through GitHub, but we also formed a Facebook group to communicate on the side as well. Hopefully IRC will be useful to communicate with class members in general. Having learned to utilize Internet resources / forums / documentation as resources really helped with finding the guides for editting markdowns this week, and when figuring out why we were downloading Vagrant and what the purpose of the commands we were using are, I came upon the following page:

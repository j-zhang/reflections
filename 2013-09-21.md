This week in class we had a guest lecture from Eric Below and one from Professor Stark. We also made sure that we were all caught up in class before next Tuesday.

Eric Berlow's lecture on Toads in Yosemite National Park was an exciting and fascinating study and application of statistics. What was astounding also is the amount of time and effort that went into conducting field studies to gather data on meadow attributes. A few issues they ran into during the study was also indicative of real problems in application of statistics, such as lack of data, sampling gaps, and also the issue of neighborhood-boosted model breeding probability. Tied to his TED Talk on "Simplifying Complexity" was the modal network of meadows, in which one can distinguish between intrinsic environments versus spatial and network quality, and impact of meadow deletion. Overall, the lecture was great motivation for what we would do this semester with regards to earthquake prediction. Professor Stark later gave a lecture and further introduction to our earthquake project; we explored earthquake clustering in time and space, the claimed precursors to earthquakes, and covered some stochastic models for seismicity. In covering various models, we also went over the hypotheses for the tests. Again, the lecture was a great way for us to be exposed to real projects and the application of statistics.

Finally, in trying to get caught up for class, Kristina and Chris set up office hours to help everyone get up to speed. They were very nice and helpful, and scheduled to meet with me before class on Thursday. Chris and I worked again to start up iPython Notebook through our original methods, and we tried using PuTTY and Cygwin, but those methods continued to not work. Their other suggestion and option was to dual boot Ubuntu on my Windows computer, which we did. Since I had previously learned from the first few weeks how to access the BIOS settings on my laptop, we were able to access the boot menu quickly, and Chris helped me install Ubuntu. Going through similar steps as before, we ran commands to change the port settings as well, and ultimately successfully opened iPython Notebook on the web browser. Chris also helped draw a diagram to show how the ports between guest and host worked, which was helping in understanding why we were changing the port locations. I think moving forward in the class, diagrams and simple explanations of how our tools work could be helpful. Also, as Professor Culich has mentioned in class, these are real world problems in reproducibility, and the lesson is that road blocks happen and we need to learn how to work independently and with each other to solve these problems. I look forward to next week's class and continuing to work with my group. Additionally, since I will be booting through Ubuntu to work in iPython Notebook, I will need to get familiar and practice navigating in Ubuntu.

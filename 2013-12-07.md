I'm really lucky to be in the group that I'm in. After many weeks, I think yesterday was one of the most collaborative, efficient, and productive workdays we've had. Our communication is smooth, and we know when we start going in directions that veer away from our session's critical path. We have a better sense for what we need and want to accomplish. We effectively use the white board, and do a lot of diagramming and thinking there. We throw out a lot of ideas and can discuss and build off each other's ideas. Our "pair" (group) programming skills are improving; we can much more easily find helpful documentation and examples from the web. 

I think our group also found a balance yesterday between the science problem and reproducibility / collaboration. We're going to fine-tune and improve our notebooks to be notebooks that shine on their own, and contribute a portion to the prediction problem, but the bulk will be refining our documentation for reproducing our IPython notebooks, which in fact has been the bulk of where we've spent our time as well. We're now setting up a vagrant box to be shared with others.

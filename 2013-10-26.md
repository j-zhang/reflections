Nothing resonates as strongly this week as the previous week, but on Tuesday we did a code review and Thursday we primarily discussed in our horizontal groups about the earthquake prediction collaborative class project and also grades. I think on Tuesday, we spent the first half of class reproducing our classmates' iPython Notebooks, and viewing their earthquake plots. I felt a lot more comfortable going through this time around, and iPython Notebook was much more familiar. I really liked <a href="https://github.com/reenashah/recent-quakes-Group11">group 11's product</a>, and thought they did a great job of the visualization aspect, with the 3D touch to their map, and there was good documentation and the cells and code had helpful descriptions. I thought that groups overall touched upon one part of the project and focused a lot of time there, such as data caching, or visualization, or curating the data, but there were incomplete parts. Afterwards, we went into a discussion about <a href="http://matplotlib.org/api/cm_api.html">colormap</a>, which was slightly hard to follow since we were going quickly and it was a lot of code to digest. I can see how it doesn't necessarily make sense to be going over these tools in class necessarily, but I'm also wondering what other way we can be "taught" some of these tools instead of completely re-tackling each new unfamiliar assignment in the dark.

On Thursday, we spent the first third of class going over grades. This was an extremely frustrating conversation. For everyone in the class, our "grade," however hard we've been working the first half of the semester, had essentially been discounted, since we were all "granted amnesty." Regardless of if we were doing well or poorly, we were all starting off on a clean slate. We also started taking attendance in the class for the first time, with a sign-in sheet, but it's week 9 of the class. I counted on Tuesday, and only 20 students out of 44 showed up on time to class, and eventually another 10 or so would trickle in by the next half hour. While it is understandable that this is a new course this semester, accountability, which has been stressed before, is only recently being enforced. We then talked a bit about being evaluated by vertical and horizontal groups, but we're potentially switching vertical groups (unclear at this point) and we're only starting to work with horizontal groups as of late this week. To my understanding, we're also going to be evaluated based on the product we create. Overall, things are still very unclear.

Next we started discussing the larger project in a bit more depth, and broke out into horizontal groups. In the analyzer group, we need to fit and optimize the model for the class. My largest concern was that all of the models are largely based on stochastic processes. The level of statistics that we need to apply feels overwhelming, and especially replicating what a Ph.D. did for his dissertation. To understand an ETAS model or automatic alarm model at a surface level is one thing, but to understand the entirety of the theory feels very daunting, albeit we may not need to fully comprehend for the project. To that end, it feels like we're drafting a paper for the sake of drafting a paper. I think our analyzer group is challenged by the situation, and we'll work hard to tackle the problem as best as we can. Another issue is that since attendance / participation / student motivation has been low in recent weeks, half of our group wasn't there. It's really tough when you want to work with your entire group on a project / assignment, but we'll likely end up spending a large majority of that time catching up with our classmates due to their absence. There also just feel like a lot of uncertainty and confusion around what we're supposed to complete by Tuesday's class. 

Also, we spent a few minutes in class talking about goals for the class, and communicating that with instructors, however I felt like that's why we submitted the survey and documented our responses. I hope that our goals and feedback will be read and addressed. As well as our reflections.

I had a good working session on Wednesday trying to get started on the assignment. After the helpful session last class when we tried to reproduce our classmates' projects, I had learned how to walk through iPython Notebook, but was missing access to some of the packages they were using. This time around, I followed the instructions from the assignment page, and installed new packages. I remembered to clone the repository so I could access the iPython Notebook when I open up in the browser
```git
git clone https://github.com/j-zhang/recent-quakes
```
When installing pandas, I at first tried the command, 
```python
pip install pandas
```
but this failed to work when I ran the example Notebook. I explored a few websites, including http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html and http://nbviewer.ipython.org/, and instead used the command
```python
sudo apt-get install python-pandas
```
After successfully re-running the Notebook that Aaron demonstrated in class, I explored using JSON as a data source. Some of the issues I ran into are documented here: https://github.com/stat157/recent-quakes/issues/3. While I'm currently still stuck on the issue, working through all this and searching online and using resources like the iPython Notebook website, Python documentation, and StackOverflow for JSON problems, I definitely learned a lot and am more comfortable working in iPython Notebook and have more familiarity with Python.

This week, reproducibility was the key. It was really interesting to see the presentations of our classmates, as we all took different approaches to completing the project and ran into various roadblocks. I think the takeaways from these presentations are paying the cost upfront, understanding expectations, perfection is the enemy, and focusing on reproducibility and collaboration.

For our own group, I think although we did not present in iPython and work with Python for using the Google Spreadsheet API, our group really focused on working early, failing early, realizing expectations early, and being cognizant and respectful of our groupmates' schedules.

The in-class activity of reproducing our classmates' work was very helpful to me. At first I was worried that most of them had used iPython Notebook, but walking through the steps was very helpful. Even though the instructions weren't the most clear, I used my knowledge from OH of the previous weekend, and countless walkthrough of working with the Vagrantfile to try and reproduce their assignment. I rebooted in Ubuntu, opened the terminal, and ssh'ed into Vagrant. From OH, I learned that you have to clone the group's repository, and cloned into the same directory as the previous questionnaire assignment for the class. I then opened iPython Notebook in my browser, and was able to access that group's repository and related files. Having learned how to navigate vi in OH, I was able to edit the config file. Then, when in iPython Notebook, I ran through the cells, and encountered an error regarding Python packages, and Aaron explained that we needed to add an extra:
```python
--pylab=inline
```
to the existing command 
```python
ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0
```
I gave this a try in class, and tried re-running the cells, but encountered the same erorr. I am hoping to resolve and understand this issue before the next class.

However, overall that reproducibility exercise in class was really helpful for me to move past R and better familiarize myself with iPython Notebook and practice it more. I've become more comfortable with these tools, and am now not as overwhelmed by the iPython Notebook, and hopefully moving forward will become more familiar with Python as well. I thought the exercise was valuable, also in reinforcing the importance of reproducibility, and made me think about how our group could have improved our instructions and process to make it more reproducible.

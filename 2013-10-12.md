This week, reproducibility was the key. It was really interesting to see the presentations of our classmates, as we all took different approaches to completing the project and ran into various roadblocks. I think the takeaways from these presentations are paying the cost upfront, understanding expectations, perfection is the enemy, and focusing on reproducibility and collaboration.

For our own group, I think although we did not present in iPython and work with Python for using the Google Spreadsheet API, our group really focused on working early, failing early, realizing expectations early, and being cognizant and respectful of our groupmates' schedules.

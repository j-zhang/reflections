It was good to see our instructors providing us feedback after having read our feedback. I think our group is taking everything we've learned in this class and what we've been taught are important, and applying it to our subgroup's tasks. While we've provided comments and feedback through surveys and in class and in office hours, I think the feedback received via email stood out because it directly responded to some of our comments. I'm particularly interested in how class goes tomorrow, as Aaron discusses expectations for the December 12th Data Science Faire, and also around grading. It'll be really helpful to understand what kind of product or output is expected of us for next month, and if we're having a final, and if so, what that'll be. It feels like in recent classes, it's more fuzzy what other groups are doing, and how their part is contributing the project; this is likely because the presenters haven't met as much, but also because we've been having working sessions. Hopefully we can do mini-updates / presentations to get back on the same page. Also, with a grant from Amazon Web Services, it'll be interesting to see how we integrate AWS into the course / project. It almost feels like we have a host of new topics that we need to cover, tackle and apply to the earthquake prediction project, and hopefully we can break out the groups and have each group tackle a small piece simultaneously.

2013-10-02: This week in class we're focusing more on getting together in new groups, working out how to collaborate with each other, and learning new tools as we work. Yesterday in class, we were assigned based on our questionnaire and learning style / group role, a role as curator, producer, entrepreneur and presenter. We were also told that we would form new vertical groups in our next assignment, which at first while hesitant, I think is an important skill to keep working on. With Google Calendar going, and our first assignment, I'm glad that the class is becoming more structured and organized. The github Questionnaire repository contains helpful information and clearer instructions on what is expected of us. So far, I've tried to start the discussion with both my vertical and horizontal group so we can get in contact with each other and start the commmunication early on instead of later. Some of us are already talking with each other on how we can get the assignment done, how we're going to learn Python in conjunction with our knowledge of R, and what some of the best methods will be for accomplishing our task. I think that as everyone in our two groups starts communicating more, and the flow of conversation increases, we'll really get more productivity as everyone has something to contribute and will help provide a unique perspective. I hope that this one week will be enough for all of us to tackle this assignment, but I'm hopeful. It was also great that both Kristina and Aaron were so responsive regarding some issues that our horizontal group had run into, which was one student not being enrolled in the class. This then led to conversations on how to improve the dialogue within our group, and suggestions on how to keep the conversation going and speaking in OH with regards to other suggestions that the instructors had.

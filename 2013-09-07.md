===========

The introduction of Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science on day 1 was completely different than how my other classes have usually begun, in the sense that there was a larger class-goal in mind from the start. What also was unique was that collaboration was discussed as a key part of the class, and I think that's helped set the tone for the class and remind everyone to work together and ask questions when we need help.

What was most challenging this week was installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox, in particular because of changing the BIOS settings on my Windows 8 computer. It was difficult because I was unfamiliar with the adjustment I needed to make, and what the purpose was. During class, a classmate helped me search online for instructions specific to my computer, and after a while, I was able to get into the options during the re-start process. Moving forward, I know there are a lot of instructions / tutorials / forums that are available online for computer-specific issues, and once pointed in the right direction, searching online can be very helpful. During class what was challenging was trying to open the iPython Notebook in the browser. I was able to follow the instructions in class and install the tool, but actually using the iPython Notebook was difficult to follow, so I am hoping we will resolve it this coming week. Over the week, I also found IRC to be a helpful resource when having questions. Talking to the professor on Thursday after the first day of class was helpful in getting a head start on downloading VirtualBox and receiving guidance on what steps to follow. I think throughout the semester I will use it more as a resource to communicate with classmates with any questions I have that aren't too specific and can be communicated over IRC.

After figuring out how to install Ubuntu, I later found a resource online that has detailed instructions and step-by-step on knowing which settings to select. http://www.calebmadrigal.com/running-ubuntu-virtualbox/
It was a helpful guide that mirrored the steps I had taken to install Ubuntu, while having to ask classmates in class to confirm that I was selecting the right ones.

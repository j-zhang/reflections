Office Hours with Aaron (11:30 am - 12:30 pm)
Today after office hours with Aaron, I felt much more comfortable about the class and the analyzer role in the earthquake prediction collaborative assignment. First we discussed concerns over the course, around grading, around accountability, around my experience thus far. It was helpful to share with him my thoughts in person, and have a discussion around it, since a lot of the frustration in recent days had not been shared and addressed. It was also helpful to discuss the effort that we've been putting into the class, letting him know what we've been gaining from the course, and sharing our experiences thus far with regards to the assignments and working in our vertical and horizontal groups. We also touched upon expectations and what we expect out of our groupmates and how much time and effort they are putting into the assignments, and how to keep everyone accountable and contributing. We also talked about the projectory of the course, and how we would tackle future assignments in group settings. A vertical group is also a wider term, and could encompass more than one data curator, one analyzer, one visualizer, and one presenter; it doesn't need to be defined as such, and is more flexible. We discussed how to tackle working in the large horizontal groups, and Aaron said starting Tuesday in class, our class would devote more time into breaking out into horizontal groups and communicating that way, since scheduling for a large number of individuals is indeed challenging. I think this'll definitely help us communicate with each other better, be on the same page, and keep each other accountable, since the people who don't show up will be expected to catch up on their own time as well. When we dig deeper into our new assignment, we will also work more dynamically, and the groups could be broken down between smaller subsets of horizontal groups, with people from other horizontal groups as well.

Then, after a discuss for 45 minutes around the class, we spent 15 min talking about defining the analyzer role. I explained the thoughts and feelings and confusion I had around the assignment thus far, and Aaron helped us approach our horizontal group's role. We diagramed on the board and came up with a flow of stages: worry & confusion, ambiguity & questions, defined-ness, prioritize, and S.M.A.R.T goals. Breaking down the assignment together also really helped, and diagraming how our role fit in relationship to the other roles. Another large concern was around stochastic processes, and we helped ease our worries by discussing how the class was more so organized as a breadth-first than a depth-first class. Many of us likely want to dig in too deep initially, but we're really more focused on developing depth after attaining breadth. This was a really helpful perspective, and made sense since over the course of the last few weeks, we've been improving our working knowledge of visualization, GitHub, and Python.

Overall, this was an extremely helpful office hours, and I felt much less stressed around the course and the upcoming assignments.

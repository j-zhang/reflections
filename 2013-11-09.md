The last few days of class have been really interesting. On Saturday, my new vertical group met up in the afternoon to formulate our S.M.A.R.T goal and work on tackling the project so we'd be ready to present on Tuesday, today. We set up an agenda for what we wanted to do, to make sure we were working efficiently during the time that we were meeting. We first thought through the list of ideas the analyzer horizontal had come up with from the previous day, and collectively found a topic that interested us and that we wanted to tackle--this happened to be the magnitude-dependent automatic alarm model. Having chosen that, we formulated a S.M.A.R.T goal around it, and tried not to think too far ahead, so we focused on what would be attainable by Tuesday, yet still challenging. After exploring any software packages already available to us online, and not finding any, we further discussed the model and how we'd build our simple function. From OH on Friday, we had learned to take small steps, and this was the strategy we used during the last few days. We chose to work in iPython Notebook, and started writing out some code, but ran into a roadblock when we realized we didn't fully understand what tau meant, and didn't understand how to add floats to pandas datetime objects. After some unsuccessful digging, we decided to ask for help and continue work the next day.

The next day, Sunday, we went to OH. At the end of our visit, we weren't able to get our question answered, but learned about tuples and lists, and got to hear and see what a few of the other groups were working on. That same day, a lot more activity sprung up on GitHub as the groups started working for their Tuesday goals. It was definitely hectic, with confusion in communication between groups on what tasks were being handled, and it was stressful to see it all happening. 

Monday evening, our group met up to re-tackle the problem. It was really helpful that we all met up, because instead of the group working on solving the issue individually, we were able to brainstorm together and solve the problem. We had great discussions around the differences between using pandas datetime and python datetime, and which one was better. We talked whether we should stick to pandas date_range or use have a list of tuples for the output. As we tried various options, we searched online for documentation, stackoverflow discussions, etc. We also explored how datetime was formatted, and came upon the dateutil extension to datetime, which was extremely helpful in parsing the string representation of datetime. What worked was also using a test list of magnitudes and datetimes, so we could play around with just a few observations of data to see if our model worked. Then after that, we tried the function on the earthquake data from our previous recent-quakes homework, to see if the model gave us the correct output. By the end of the evening, we were succesful, and accomplished our S.M.A.R.T goal for Tuesday.

Today was also an extremely interesting day of class. First, this is one of the strangest classes I've ever taken. But during the day, after thinking about the class, I've come up with a few takeaways. Unlike traditional classes or jobs / internships or new clubs or activities that we join, this class is a completely new class. In other group / organization settings, you join an environment where a culture or norm has already been established, and as a new student to that class, or member to a club, you assimilate into that environment. However, this class, it's the instructors and students that are collectively building and creating that environment and culture. Today, it almost felt like the students were running the class and moving it forward. Having been working in Bechtel last night where the presenters were meeting too, I've seen them collaborate with each other very efficiently, and today in class they organized themselves well and put together the big picture for our project, and I think it helped the class understand where each of our subgroups stood in relation to the larger project. So in this class, we really have to define for ourselves, what we want the class to be like, determine what we want to and need to get accomplished by the next class or next week. Even though communication had been tough, our class is really organizing itself, and we're making headway. As Aaron mentioned, it indeed seemed like one of the first days that everyone felt more on the same page, least it felt that way. Let's see what's to come.
